# Replace gatttool dependency with gatt-python

- [ ] cleaner API for working with weekdays
- [ ] cleaner API for working with repeated schedulers - no need to provide a date here
- [ ] cleaner API - use change instead of set consistently
- [ ] move pseudo commands from cli demo to sem6000 module (i.e. reset\_timer)
